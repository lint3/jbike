# Cycling Every road in Logan.

- Improve [OSM traces](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/41.7387/-111.8292&layers=G), of which there were essentially none in Logan
- Improve my bike maintenance and repair skills
- Improve my own fitness
- Improve my carbon footprint
- Fun

- Visualize using [derive](https://erik.github.io/derive/)
- Combine each month using [viking](https://github.com/viking-gps/viking) since the above has a bug where it doesn't handle large numbers of files very well
